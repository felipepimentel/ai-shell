# AI Shell Project Specification

## Overview
AI Shell is a command-line interface (CLI) tool that uses artificial intelligence to interpret and execute user commands, focusing on natural language interaction with the shell.

## Features
- Natural language command interpretation
- Integration with OpenAI API for AI-powered responses
- Configuration management using environment variables and YAML files
- Command history tracking
- Simulation mode for safe command execution
- Expert mode for advanced users
- Result caching for improved performance
- Asynchronous command execution and initialization
- Generic shell command execution for all operations, including Git
- Conflict detection and resolution for file operations
- Dependency management and automatic installation
- Error analysis and fix suggestions
- Structured logging with configurable output and automatic initialization
- Context-aware command generation

## Project Structure

  - `cli.py`: Entry point for the CLI
  - `ai_shell.py`: Core AI Shell functionality
  - `config.py`: Configuration management
  - `datatypes.py`: Data structures for the project
  - `/llm`: Language model related functionality
    - `prompts.py`: Stores prompts for the language model
    - `openrouter_ai.py`: Integration with OpenRouter AI API
  - `/utils`: Utility functions and modules
    - `logger.py`: Structured logging functionality with automatic initialization
    - `cache.py`: Caching mechanisms and decorators
    - `error_handler.py`: Error handling and suggestions
    - `command_executor.py`: Asynchronous command execution with timeout and progress tracking
    - `conflict_resolver.py`: Handles conflicts in file operations
    - `dependency_manager.py`: Manages and installs dependencies
    - `error_analyzer.py`: Analyzes errors and suggests fixes
  - `/command`: Command processing and execution
    - `command_processor.py`: Main command processing logic
    - `command_executor.py`: Executes shell commands with simulation capabilities
    - `command_cache_manager.py`: Manages command caching
    - `command_generator.py`: Generates AI-powered commands with context
    - `command_history_manager.py`: Manages command history
    - `context_builder.py`: Builds context for AI processing

## Recent Changes
- Updated CommandGenerator to accept context in generate_command method
- Modified CommandProcessor to pass context to CommandGenerator
- Implemented ContextBuilder to create enhanced context for AI processing
- Added CommandHistoryEntry dataclass for structured command history

## TODO
- Implement more sophisticated natural language processing using the OpenRouter AI model.
- Expand the range of supported shell commands and actions.
- Implement a plugin system for extending functionality.
- Add more comprehensive error handling and recovery mechanisms.
- Implement user authentication and permission management for sensitive operations.
- Optimize caching strategy for frequently used commands and results.
- Enhance the command execution process with more advanced features like piping and redirection.
- Implement more advanced shell-based operations and conflict resolution strategies.
- Improve dependency management to handle complex dependency trees and version conflicts.
- Enhance error analysis and fix suggestions for a wider range of error types.
- Implement more advanced logging features, such as log rotation and remote logging.
- Expand simulation capabilities for a wider range of shell commands.
- Implement unit and integration tests for all major components.
- Optimize performance for handling large volumes of commands and data.
- Enhance context building to include more relevant information for AI processing.
